**RLUS: Rate Limit Update Service**

Welcome to the RLUS project repository! RLUS (Rate Limit Update Service) provides a statistical toolbox for computing and effectively managing API throttling limits. 

**Project Background**

Rate limiting is critical for managing access to APIs, protecting resources, and enabling value-added services. RLUS provides a principled approach to determining the optimal query rate limits to ensure API usage aligns with organizational goals. By leveraging statistical models and algorithms, RLUS empowers public and private entities to balance access and control effectively.

**Use Cases**

- Throttling API access for public and private services.
- Supporting value-added services while protecting sensitive system metrics.
- Preventing unauthorized analysis of service-level agreements. 
- Efficiently setting query limits for APIs based on real-time data.

**Repository Contents**

The `RLUS` repository includes the following repositories: 

 - RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH/: Binary search-based algorithm implementation.
 - RLUS-BRUTEFORCE/: Brute-force algorithm implementation.
 - RLUS-HEURISTIC_H1/ to RLUS-HEURISTIC_H4/: Various heuristic search methods.
 - README.md: Documentation of the project.


Each repository is structured as follows:

**Repository Contents**

project/
- `data/`: Contains input datasets, including daily datasets in Excel format.
  - `9_20_2017.xlsx` - `9_29_2017.xlsx`: Dataset for September 20-29, 2017.
- `results/`: Stores computed outputs (rho values), such as `.csv` files, generated by running the scripts.
- `logs/`: Contains real-time execution logs for debugging and tracking script runs.
- `scripts/`: Contains shell scripts for running, evaluating, and managing the RLUS algorithms.
  - `master_script.sh`: Orchestrates the parallel execution of various scripts, including `run_20.sh` to `run_29.sh`.
  - `measure_time.sh`: Tracks the time taken by `master_script.sh` and logs it into a time log file (`master_script_time.log`).
  - `run_20.sh` - `run_29.sh`: Executes the RLUS algorithm for date September 20-29, 2017.
- `bootstrap.py`: Implements the bootstrap method for resampling and calculating confidence intervals.
- `command_line_main.py`: The main entry point for executing the RLUS algorithm via the command line.
- `RLUS.py`: Contains the RLUS algorithm implementation.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to ignore during version control with Git.
- `Dockerfile`: Used to containerize the project to ensure the reproducibility of the environment.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for the project: `numpy`, `pandas`, and `argparse`.

**How to Use This Repository | Quick Start (Using RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH as an Example)**

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/armanalaa/RLUS.git
   ```
   ```bash
    cd RLUS/RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH
   ```
   
   ```bash
    cd RLUS/RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH
   ```

2. Set up the environment: Use Docker for a consistent and isolated environment:

     a. Building the Docker Image:

       ```bash
        docker build -t RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH .
       ```
       
     b. Run the RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH Example: Inside the container or locally (if dependencies are installed):
       
     ```bash
      # Windows
      docker run -v %cd%:/app RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH
     ```
   
       ```bash
        # Linux
        docker run -v $(pwd):/app RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH
       ```

4. Check Live Log

       ```bash
       docker logs -f RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH # Stream live logs from the Docker container.
       ```
   
       ```bash
       docker logs RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH | tail -n 100 # retrieve the last 100 lines of logs from the RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH Docker container, aiding in monitoring and debugging
       ```
 
6. Check Results

      ```bash    
      sudo docker cp RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH:/app/results .
      ```
      
      ```bash
      sudo docker cp RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH:/app/logs .
     ```

  - The commands copy the results and log directories from the /app path inside the RLUS-BINARY-SEARCH Docker container to the current directory on your host system.
  - This lets you access the container's output files directly on your local machine.
  - In the results folder, the sample size (rho) values in the .csv format are saved.
  - In the logs folder, the execution times are saved in .text format.
 
**Known Issues**

- Memory Usage: Some algorithms may require significant memory for large datasets.
- Execution Time: Brute-force algorithms are computationally expensive compared to heuristic methods.
- Docker Compatibility: Ensure Docker is correctly installed and updated.
